To implement a real-world, intelligent agent supervisor system for a car rental chatbot, we'll incorporate more advanced techniques, such as:

1/ NLP-based Intent Detection: Use a dedicated language model or intent classifier to handle complex or ambiguous user requests.
2/ Task Context Management: Track the user's conversation context, allowing follow-up questions and refining responses based on conversation history.
3/ Error Handling and Fallback Mechanism: Handle cases where no clear intent is identified and provide fallback options.
4/ Dynamic Response Generation: Use fine-tuned language models to craft responses based on the context, rather than just fixed prompts.
5/ Logging, Monitoring, and Feedback Loop: Integrate logging and monitoring for continuous improvement. 



Things we should focus on : 
- The agents are isolated and none of the agents can communicate with another the planner does all the coordination ? 
- How can i implement well the session thing ? 
- How can i do the communication between the agents ? 
- Understand and explain well the architecture basing on the previous statement ?
